Project Description

I want to work independently to create a fun arcade game where the user can choose one of a
 number charactersâ€™ to try to climb the Burj Khalifa tower. The climb will not be easy
 however, as there will be broken windows, objects falling down the sky, some clouds blurring
 the view, and other barriers. There will also be some coins and dimes which earn the user
 more points. The character will continuously keep moving up, and the speed will increase as
 it goes higher. The user can only move the character right or left. If the player reaches
 the top of the tower, then he wins and earns some coins. The character has three lives per
 game, and will die if its hit by a barrier for the third time.


Project plan - Description of Work

Phase One: Create 4-5 characters with different looks and traits

Phase Two: Create the burj khalifa background and adjust key controls

Phase Three:   Add barriers, sound effects, score count

Phase Four:    Add coins, coin counter, and items to buy using coins such as props (hair, jewlery, clothes) etc..

Phase Five:    Adjust number of lives the character has and add/fix minor details
