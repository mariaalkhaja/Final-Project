Final Project Proposal


Project Description
I want to word independently to create a fun arcade game where the user can choose one of a number charactersâ€™ to try to climb the Burj Khalifa tower. The climb will not be easy however, as there will be broken windows, objects falling down the sky, some clouds blurring the view, and other barriers. There will also be some coins and dimes which earn the user more points. The character will continuously keep moving up, and the speed will increase as it goes higher. The user can only move the character right or left. If the player reaches the top of the tower, then he wins and earns some coins. The character has three lives per game, and will die if its hit by a barrier for the third time.
